This is a one player pong game written for a digital
systems design course. It's implemented in HW in
VHDL for a Terassic DE2-70 dev-kit, which uses an 
Altera Cyclone II FPGA.

The player controls a paddle that moves vertically 
across the screen and deflects a red ball. The player 
scores points for deflecting the ball and is given 4
lives. As the score increases the ball will begin to 
speed up to make the game more challenging.

The circuit features
o A VGA Sync generator
o A Character ROM to form the Score Display
o Varying clock for the ball to speed it up
